# Image Server with REST API
#### REST project of Middleware Technologies for Distributed Systems course at Politecnico di Milano

The server allows the user to register, to login, to upload, retrieve and delete their images through REST APIs.
Moreover, it serves a simple website to easily interact with them.
The APIs comply with the third level of HATEOAS principles, using http methods, status codes and hypermedia.

The requirements of the project are listed in [this pdf file](https://github.com/cristiangiann/mtds-project-rest/blob/master/deliverables/requirements.pdf).
